                  This came as 1,394 private homes were launched last month, up from 444 units in April as well as the 1,060 units in May last year. The figures – 
                  which exclude executive condominium (EC) units – were released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority on Monday based on its survey of licensed 
                  housing developers. No EC units were launched or sold last month.
