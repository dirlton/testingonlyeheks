                  Private home prices defied the pandemic-induced recession to rise again in the final three months of 2020 - the third consecutive quarter of increase. The 
                  price index climbed 2.1 per cent in the final three months of last year, well ahead of the 0.8 per cent increase in the third quarter, noted Urban Redevelopment 
                  Authority flash estimates yesterday. This was the steepest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2018, when private home prices rose 3.4 per cent before 
                  cooling measures hit in July that year.

                  The bigger picture was not so robust with private home prices increasing 2.2 per cent for 2020, less than the 2.7 per cent gain in 2019. The fourth-quarter 
                  increase was driven mainly by homes in the rest of central region, where values rose 4.8 per cent, and the core central region, up 3.3 per cent. Prices in the 
                  outside central region advanced 1.7 per cent, the same as the previous quarter.

                  <h1 class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-justify">
                  The rest of central region led the way last year as a whole, with prices up 5.1 per cent, followed by the outside central region at 3.1 per cent, while values in 
                  the prime core central region fell 0.2 per cent compared with 2019. Some new project launches in the fourth quarter could have boosted prices, said Ms Christine Sun, 
                  head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee &amp; Tie.

                   Ms Tricia Song, Colliers International's research head for Singapore, said developers sold 2,381 new private homes - excluding executive condos - in the last three 
                   months of 2020, down 32.3 per cent from the third quarter and a marginal 2.5 per cent decline year on year. This should bring full-year new sales to 9,760 units, 
                   down 1.5 per cent from 9,912 in 2019, she added.

                  <h1 class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-justify">
                    Sales in the secondary market were more resilient in the fourth quarter, down just 5.6 per cent quarter on quarter but up 36.9 per cent year on year. 
                    This brought full-year secondary sales to 9,905 units, up 7.2 per cent from 9,238 in 2019, said Ms Song.

                    Huttons Asia research head Lee Sze Teck said up to 20 new launches can be expected in the first quarter of this year, with around 9,000 new units hitting the 
                    market. "Selling prices are expected to edge up because of recent firm land tender prices and higher construction costs because of Covid-19 safety management 
                    measures," he said.
